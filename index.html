      <h2>About Courtney</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Courtney Vacek, the hands and heart behind Knot By Sight. Legally blind since childhood, I experience the world through touch — and that’s exactly how I create.

      <h2>Mini Wall Hanging – "Desert Calm"</h2>
      <p>
        Hand-knotted with 100% cotton cord, this piece channels the peaceful stillness of a desert sunrise. Each knot is a meditative step in Courtney's unique process.
